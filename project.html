                    <p class="first">The main part of whole Nft world is a Nft marketplace , And the user of the
                        marketplace will always look for convnience over how the market place would look,And because of
                        this reason I have come up with a UI fo Nft marketplace with super easy navigation and make user
                        comfortable to use the website/app. </p>

                    <p class="second ">The motivation for building this type of UI revovles around the young
                        generation , Here I have designed the page in a way which will have a Gen-z vibe , I tried to
                        display features in as unique way as possible.As a UI/UX designer a orange color scheme is a
                        bold color scheme but I tried to make it as subtle as possible. </p>

                    <h2>&#8692; Interior design Landing page UI</h2>
                    <p class="first">In todays world as most the things have become digital so is the interior design
                        industry,The only work which is done person to person in the interior design industry is the
                        actual construction the stages before them are all digital ,So here I have created a design for
                        Interior design website with keeping all the things relevant and focused to interior design and
                        my aim while designing was that the user should recognize that this is a Interior design website
                        in first few seconds. </p>

                    <p class="second ">Year 2022 has been no good for Ukraine as they were attacked by Russia which
                        eventually resulted in loss of lifes.And to support Ukraine and it's people I developed a design
                        for fund gathering,donations and support of any kind to Ukranian people.Here I have kept the
                        UI simple and only used colors from the Ukranian flag and my main motive was that people donate
                        as much as they can so I added donate links in more amount than usual but made sure it doesn't
                        look overwhelming. </p>
